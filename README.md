> `Proj.sbs` Subdomain **service will be ended on October 20th, 2024 (UTC)**. All the subdomains will not be accessible after the service is ended, and the GitHub repository of this project ([`proj-at/subdomains`](https://github.com/proj-at/subdomains)) will be archived. To avoid being affected, you may need to migrate as soon as possible.
> 
> We started this project because we would like to make previewing easier for developers so that they can launch their projects, documentation sites, or other open-source websites easily and quickly. However, we found this is not convenient for developers because the process of creating, reviewing, and merging a PR is not efficient. That's one of the main reasons we end this project.
> 
> To avoid being affected, you may need to:
> - Check all your projects or services that is using any domain or subdomain of `proj.sbs`.
> - If the subdomain is owned by you, you may need to copy your records and change them to your own domain or other services.
> - If the subdomain is not owned by you, you may need to contact them by using the email information or other contact information that they left in the record file.
>
> Thank you for your understanding.
